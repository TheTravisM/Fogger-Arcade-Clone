			<p>Need some additional help getting started with the Classic Arcade Game Clone Project, or simply curious and
				want to learn a little bit more? Watch the following Webcasts!</p>

			<p>These webcasts are recordings of live Q&amp;A sessions and demos. They have been edited to be shorter and more
				relevant to newer rubrics. As always, you should read the appropriate rubric for your project thoroughly before
				you begin work on any project and double check the rubric before submitting. They videos were made by Udacity's
				coaches. Think of them as extra supplemental materials. You can find an archive of our webcasts in their
				entirety in the discussion forums under <a href="https://discussions.udacity.com/t/webcasts-summaries/22538/1"
				                                           target="_blank">Webcasts Summaries</a>.</p>

			<p><strong>Here you will find webcasts on the project rubric and exceeding expectations, details on the JS files
				provided, general object oriented programming concepts, an explanation of HTML 5 canvas with animation, using
				the console and Chrome Developer Tools and a video with various Q &amp; A.</strong></p>
